These are instructor notes to help guide a review discussion of [Film Project, Part 4](https://git.generalassemb.ly/react-development/react-development-course-materials/blob/master/04-APIs%20and%20Heroku/08-film-project-part4.md).

**As you review, remember to ask students, "What questions do you have?" and not "Do you have any questions?"**


## Taking it further

Here are some optional things you can suggest students do to deepen their knowledge and take this app further:

- Refactor `Fave` into a functional component.
- Move the filters into a `FilmListingFilter` component.
- Implement client-side routing to show multiple pages of films.
- Go through the CSS and see how the app is styled (it uses both flexbox and CSS Grid).
- Add a textarea for a review to each film detail and save that on the film object.
- Show an icon in `FilmListing` for all films with reviews.
- Show the `fave` state of a film on `FilmDetails`.
- Add any other features you can think of!
