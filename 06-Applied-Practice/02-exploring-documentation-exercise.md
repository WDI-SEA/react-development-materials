<h1>Exercise: Exploring Documentation</h1>

---

## Task

In small groups, choose one of the following questions to research in the React.js documentation.

Create a compelling presentation that:

- Answers the question.
- Provides examples to the audience through learning materials, diagrams, and more.
- Is interactive (bonus).

---

## Overview
Each group will have:

- Fifteen minutes to research the question.
- Ten minutes to structure a presentation.
- Five minutes to present.

**Note:** All group members must participate in the presentation.

## Question Bank

- What is a controlled component in React? How is it different from regular HTML forms?

- What is an uncontrolled component in React? Why would we use one instead of a controlled component?

- What is a synthetic event and how does it compare to regular DOM events?

- What is a `ref`? List the pros and cons of using one.

- Describe one-way and two-way data binding. Which model does React use? Explain and compare to other popular front-end frameworks.

- Describe how to best gather information from a form in React. Be prepared to show code.

- Compare and contrast conditional rendering and the `shouldComponentUpdate()` life-cycle method. When would we use one over the other?

- Compare and contrast stateful, stateless, and functional components in React. List the pros and cons of each. When would we use one over the other?

- Is there a life-cycle method to prevent the initial rendering of a React component? Explain why or why not.

**Teaching Tips**:

- Have each group choose a different question to answer so there's no repetition.
- Circulate while the groups are developing their presentations.
- Time the presentations so the activity moves along (each should be no longer than five minutes).
