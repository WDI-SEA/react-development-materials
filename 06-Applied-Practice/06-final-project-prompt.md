## Project Overview

It's time to build something you'll be proud to call your own.

This is an open-ended project. We can't provide any set solution, but we're always here to help.

You'll be making your own website. This can be a website you imagine, but feel free to pick an existing website and try to mimic it. Some sites that use React that you can model yours after are:

  - https://www.airbnb.com/
  - https://citymapper.com/boston
  - https://reddit.com
  - https://www.instagram.com/
  - https://www.nytimes.com/

Once you have a website with basic functionality that you're satisfied with, look at the "Further Directions" section and choose at least one of the options to implement.

---

## Requirements

* Utilize both nested components and state.
* Use React Router and include a nav bar.
* Use ES6 syntax; don't forget about functional components.

---

## Suggestions and Hints

- Don't worry about styling at first. Focus on getting the functionality working.
- Remember that state and props are **not** the same.
  - State represents the **state** of your user interface component.
  - State can trigger changes in props, and props can come from parent components.
- Stick to functional programming techniques wherever possible (e.g., use built-in methods such as `.forEach()` and `.map()` if available).
- If you're rendering a list of child components (such as a `ul` -> `li` list), each individual child component needs a unique key for React to work with it. This is so React can identify each element uniquely, if necessary, and help with optimizing by easily identifying virtual DOM objects through unique keys.

---

## Further Directions

Once you have a website with basic functionality that you're satisfied with, choose at least one of the options below to implement.

* **Option 1:** Learn about React styling. Create a new React application and recreate the UI, or apply styling to the project you started in the last exercise.
* **Option 2:** Learn about React animations and apply them to the blog or project you built in the last exercise.
* **Option 3:** In addition to animations, incorporate Flow — a static type checker — into your application.

## Deliverables

When you're satisfied with your web application and have implemented at least one of the further options, host it on Heroku. Share the link and your repository with your instructor.


Enjoy the challenge!

**Talking Point**:

- Note: We don't have a database set up, so if you need data, feel free to hard-code a little (just enough to get the idea) or use `fetch()` to call an API.

## Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated based on the rubric below.

| Score | Expectations |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 | Incomplete |
| 1 | Does not meet expectations |
| 2 | Meets expectations — good job! |
| 3 | Exceeds expectations — fantastic! |


Here's an example of how the rubric works. Let's say your assignment was to cook pizza:

Criteria | **0** (Incomplete) | **1** (Does not meet expectations) | **2** (Meets expectations) | **3** (Exceeds expectations) |
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
Crust | No crust present. Submission is just cheese and sauce on a plate. | Pizza has a crust, but it's raw. | Crust is cooked thoroughly.| Crust is golden brown and the perfect thickness.
Cheese | No cheese present. | A small sprinkle of unmelted cheese in the middle of the pie. | Cheese covers the pizza from edge to edge but is not fully melted. | Cheese is delicious, plentiful, and melted to perfection.
