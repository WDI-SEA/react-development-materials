**Teaching Tips:**

- Some students might not want to present, and that's absolutely fine. This is just their chance to show off what they've done.
- Compliment their projects. They've worked hard!
- After the presentations, ask students what their plans are. Give tips and offer suggestions.
- Encourage the entire class to keep in touch, use each other as a resource, and network.
- Encourage the entire class to stay active in the GA alumni community.
