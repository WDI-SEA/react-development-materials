3) **React Tic-Tac-Toe Application**: Lab

4) **React ATM Application**: Lab

5) **Idea Board**: Code-along

Notes: 
- Item 5 is the code-along script for the instructor (except for the introductory slides, not student-facing).
- Item 5 is a code-along that requires approximately six hours to complete, so plan accordingly. For 10-week deliveries, the activity will take up three full class sessions.
