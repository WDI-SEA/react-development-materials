Notes:

- The Film Project is homework, but you can begin it in class. The full script of that lesson is student-facing, rather than embedded in the instructor-facing Teaching Tips or Talking Points.

- The quiz is hosted on myGA. The file in this repo provides a URL to slack to your students. This quiz is just for practice. Students do not need to log in, and the platform will not record their scores.
