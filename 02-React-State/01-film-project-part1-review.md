<h1>Review: Film Project, Part 1</h1>

<aside class="notes">

These are instructor notes to help guide a review discussion of [Film Project, Part 1](../01-React-Key-Concepts/10-film-project-part1/10-film-project-part1.md).

**As you review, remember to ask students: "What questions do you have?" and not: "Do you have any questions?"**

Notes to cover in homework review:

- Make sure students are using proper naming conventions when building their `FilmListing` and `FilmDetails` components.
- Make sure each component is in its own file.
- Review the `import` keyword and importing film details.
- Make sure students properly used the `getFullYear()` method for the `release_date`.
