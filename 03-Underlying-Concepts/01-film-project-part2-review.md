These are instructor notes to help guide a review discussion of [Film Project, Part 2](https://git.generalassemb.ly/react-development/react-development-course-materials/blob/master/02-React%20State/12-film-project-part2.md).

**As you review, remember to ask students: "What questions do you have?" and not: "Do you have any questions?"**


**Talking Points**:

- Events: Are all of the click events firing and changing the UI? Have they stopped propagation?
- State: Have they successfully added state? Does the state change and update the UI when needed?
- Do students understand unidirectional binding? Are all of their `this` calls working accordingly?
- Talk through any sticking points. Were there any common places where students were "stuck"?
