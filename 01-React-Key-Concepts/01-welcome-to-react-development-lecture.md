<h1>Welcome to React Development</h1>

<img src="images/react-logo.png" alt="react logo" class="responsive" />

<aside class="notes">

* Overview
This lesson serves as the kick-off for your React Development course. Whether you’re delivering this course online or in person, in a 1-week, accelerated or 10-week, part-time format, take the first hour or so of your time together to start things off on the right foot.

This lesson is designed to introduce yourself and GA and get the students comfortable and excited to learn. After that, there's a brief review of the pre-work.

* Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Define class expectations and norms.
- Understand key concepts introduced in the pre-work.


* Duration
60 minutes


* Before Class: Preparation
- Update the following slides with specific information about you, your class, your city, and your local support team.
- Take some time to consider your expectations for learners, and be prepared to talk about them.
- Choose an "ice breaker" to run that will allow learners to get to know one another in a fun, informal, low-stakes way. We have a list of activities [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a91IqhzijI_3EqU-trJbZN4vDDSU0rXqgIrqGwsWM7I/edit) for you to choose from (as well as other good slides to copy). If you have some good ones, feel free to share your ideas with us!
- Before class, review completion data to understand how far your learners have progressed through the myGA pre-work.
-- If most of your learners have completed the pre-work, you should be able to breeze through this lesson very quickly.
-- If most of your learners have not completed all of the pre-work, you might want to spend more time on this lesson and reduce your timings for the rest of the lessons in Unit 1.

## Some Key Features of React

- Declarative views: They make your code more readable and easier to debug.
- Virtual DOM: A virtual copy of the original DOM. Manipulating it (over the original DOM) speeds things up.
- Event handling: No need to worry about incompatible event names and fields.
- JSX: Markup syntax you'll use for generating strings of HTML that are almost identical to the HTML you'll insert into the webpage.
- Component-based: In React, everything on the webpage is divided into small components to create a view (or UIs).
<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- On this and all following slides, don't just read the text; add in your own experience and thoughts.

</aside>

---

## When to Use React

- If your project involves many components with different, often-changing states (e.g., active/inactive navigation items, accordion sections expanded/collapsed, dynamic inputs, buttons active/disabled, user login and access permissions).

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- If you know of any specific examples, talk about them!

</aside>

---

## When NOT to Use React

Other programming languages exist; React isn't great for everything! Avoid using React with:

- Devices with limited hardware capabilities.
- Webpage widgets such as Botsplash Chat that are installed on third-party websites.

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- If you know of any specific examples, talk about them!

</aside>

## Q&A and Summary

What other questions do you have?



<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:
