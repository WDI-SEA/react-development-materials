In the [Creating a WeatherIcons Component](https://codepen.io/jkeohan/pen/NLdOwb?editors=) CodePen, you will find five weather elements generated within the HTML section.

## Perform the following to complete the exercise:

- Create an array called `weatherData` that will contain five objects with the following properties: `img`, `conditions`, and `time`.
- Populate those objects based on those values assigned in the HTML.
- Create a `WeatherIcons` component and pass it the `weatherData` array as `props`.
- The `WeatherIcons` component will then render five `weather` `<div>`s based on properties of the objects in the `weatherData` array.
