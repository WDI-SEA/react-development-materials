This is Unit 4 of the complete React Development course. It includes the following:

1. **Review of Film Project, Part 3**: Discussion

2. **Introduction to APIs**: Interactive lecture

3. **Transferring Data**: Interactive lecture

4. **`fetch()`**: Interactive lecture 

5. **Displaying the Weather**: Continuation of blog project

6. **Heroku**: Interactive lecture

7. **APIs, Heroku, and Imperative and Declarative Programming Quiz**: Online quiz

8. **Film Project, Part 4**: Class work and homework

9) Optional: **API Dad Jokes Lab** (available in [Extra Resources](https://git.generalassemb.ly/react-development/react-development-course-materials/tree/master/Additional%20Resources/Dad%20Jokes%20Lab) folder)

Notes:

- The Film Project is homework (but you can begin it in class). The full script of that lesson is student-facing (rather than embedded in the instructor-facing teaching tips or talking points).

- The quiz covers imperative and declarative programming in addition to APIs and Heroku. If you haven't covered all of this material, don't assign the quiz.
